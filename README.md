### My Development Philosophy

I believe that software development should focus on **clean code, fast execution, and simplicity**. Whether I’m designing a **Linux-based automation tool**, creating a small **C++ utility**, or fine-tuning my development environment, my goal is always to make my tools and code **efficient**, **reliable**, and **easy to maintain**.

### Fun Facts

- I prefer using the **command line** for most tasks because it’s faster and more efficient.
- I’m always exploring new tools to improve my productivity — currently looking into **Rust** and **systems programming**.
- I believe **simplicity** is key — whether in code or in my development environment.
