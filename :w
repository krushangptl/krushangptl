#### Krushang Patel

Just a guy who loves hanging out in the terminal, making Linux do whatever I want, 
and figuring out how systems tick from the inside. 
Obsessed with code, scripts, and anything that runs close to the metal.

**Fun Fact**

- Explore Ubuntu and now having fun breaking and fixing **Arch btw!**
- Alacritty + Tmux + **Neovim** = my natural habittat (yup, I escape with `q!` in my head)
- Python for scripting, diving deep into **C** and **Go** on the long journey ahead
- Chronic **skill issue** sufferer, but grinding every day
- Here to learn, build and connect with people who get it
